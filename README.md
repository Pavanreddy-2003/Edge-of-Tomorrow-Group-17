Precision Farming Using IOT


Install all the hardware components in the field with crop mainly what   we measure.
Collect all the data from the field where the project is installed and send it to cloud where it visualizes the data sent from Arduino and we have GSM module also to send a message to the user when the values cross a certain threshold limit.
We can use the data produced by this project for better understanding of the crop yields.
Using these values we can predict how crop behaves in certain conditions and how it affects crop yield.
